# My Review Of The Timeless Way Of Building: 

The book is structured in four parts. The beginning is a summery of the whole book, reading it will allow one to understand not only what is the book going to talk about, but also it's fundamental structure. The other three parts are about the elusive quality the author wants buildings to contain, then, how can we reach this quality, lead by practical examples of how he did it, making his ideas more concrete.

Chapter 8 is where we learn about why the book was written. We learn that the author thinks modern building is lifeless, boring almost, and so modular and reused that it lacks any character. They don't trigger the same emotions that older buildings, towns, villages, contain. When entering a old cathedral that was built by the people who lived there, you find an elusive quality that makes you feel a certain way. Whether because of the sheer size, art, light, sound, history, location, materials, colors, ... you can tell immediately the grandness and beauty the place has; along with the spiritual nature it contains and tries to amplify. 

I for myself can say that I felt this quality in a wooden house in the north where my family for a couple years went on vacation there. I remember how warm the house felt, with the green grass complimenting it's nature; the cozy old feel which is given by the slight screeching sounds of wood when walking and the scenery of mountains when looking outside, the grapevines growing on the sides of the main walk way and the calmness which the environment had. Peace. The fun we had wen we all sat around the big table after cooking a meal, going to the pool, enjoying life, eating to our hearts content. All these attributes contributed into making a kind of quality which I had not felt from any other house I had been to. 

The author correctly recognizes that the quality lies in the events that happen in a place more than the place itself; yet they can not be separated as they effect each other, for without the place there would be no events. The roads that we use to get around, the parks that we use to communicate with our friends, and so on... these are places where events that take place in them, are helped by the environment which they occur in. Each part of a village in this way if it hast the quality can contribute to the holistic big picture we want to create. 

"A building or a town is given it's character, essentially, by those events which keep on happening there most often." - [ chapter 4, page 66 ]

Buildings that we see today have almost no variation. They all are rectangular with many rooms and layouts which are repeated. Nature also repeats yet we don't find trees repeat the same way: although there are many trees, each of their twigs and leaves are have slight variations all over, giving them their character and uniqueness. They follow the pattern of a leave or twig as we recognize them yet contain variations we appreciate. In much of the same nature that history doesn't repeat, it rhymes, he wants our buildings to rhyme not repeat one another. 

To do so is impossible though our current centralized methodologies. Architects who build massive constructions may do so by abstracting the needs of the people and the events which occur in the places they build, but they do not attend to the specific needs the people have, they don't make the place unique. It is far too complex to do it in such a way. Needing an architect for each family or person which needs something to be designed and built is impossible. We simply can't have that many architects.

The timeless way of building is, in-fact, a decentralized process where people have a common shared language for building, and the building or town or village or city grow organically from the gradual attending of needs, the people themselves help to attend their needs they can tell not only what they are, but have a language to communicate it well. 

From a language that builds a house, building, park and so on.. to a language used to describe a village, town, city. The language he proposes it incomplete since it must utilize the people's ideas themselves to fit it into the specific area people and culture. To complete it a decentralized process of people trying the ideas must be done: define, discuss, criticize, and improve the patterns to fit the needs of the people. Then the last step is to share so the work of people is cumulative.

Each decision on it's own right not be perfect but with time, as you make wrong decisions you learn, modify, grow. We want autonomous people making their own decisions about how to build. But these people who we add should be allowed to make small changes to the whole and usually defined to what they can easily access and change (their own house, garden, so on..) and do so using the shared language they have. We know whether we are right or wrong when we feel a certain way. Every human will recognize this feeling when things are right or wrong. Because of their culture, location and past, people can share the meaning and experience of building and thus grow a town in according to the timeless method.

Nothing will cry so hard for it's own death as it wishes to be reborn anew, then a building that not longer fits it's owners.

The language proposed is isomorphic in my mind to a formal method. It has axioms, which are truths about building, such as the space we have for a building is 100m^2, and light comes from the south-eastern side; it also has rules which we gather and learn about or invent, for how should we build given the axioms. The patterns which form inside the language have a great variety, but they always follow the rules. Another name which he gives this language is "rules of thumb". Everybody follows rules of thumb when, doing, well... most things in the world, and so does building. The strength of a language is it's compactness. We need just a few buildings blocks and rules to represent a great variety of possibilities. This allows both our chaotic individualistic nature and our need for structure to be served in one meal. The structure is kept by the rules but they don't confine our possibilities by a few options, instead allowing the randomness we like to take shape in whichever way fits best.

"Architects are responsible for no more than perhaps 5 percent of all the buildings in the world. 
Most buildings, streets, shops, offices, rooms, kitchens, cafes, factories, gas stations, freeways, bridges... which give the world it's form, come from an entirely different source. 
They come from the work of thousands of different people.
They come from the decisions of administrators, hardware store-owners, housewives, official building department, local bankers, carpenters, public works, departments, gardeners, painters, city councils, families ..."  [ pp 200 ]

It is a fact that this method can work, most of the world is built this way. Why not begin building using The Timeless Way?
