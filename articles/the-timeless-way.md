# The Timeless Way Of Building Book Review 

The book details Alexander's gripe with modern lifeless buildings, venerating old design with their elusive "Quality" he so carefully defines the shape of.

Book layout:
    Nameless Quality
    Modernism lacks it, Traditionalism has it (the problem)
    The Timeless Way (solution)
    Practical application

Recently I read Christopher Alexander's "The Timeless Way Of Building". The book is an architecture book but not in the typical way people might assume or find in a bookstore. You won't find layout pictures or abstract theories on building and form. Instead, it is a philosophical book, leaning towards a more spiritual view of buildings and ideals of them. That said, you will find many of his ideas are more general then what a surface level scan might show, and after poking around, it seems to truly have had influence on software architecture, a completely different subject.

## The Quality Without A Name

The book begins by searching for a certain quality the author believes to hold the key to the making of a great building. 

This quality as we learn is without a name, and rightfully so. Looking at traditional homes 


Alexander's theory is that there is a certain quality in buildings which emerges 
The author believes that t here is some quality with out a name and we should search for it in buildings we build. 
that exists in traditional homes which makes them 

 To explain this "quality without a name" he uses many words that only describe a little of what he means (alive, whole, comfortable, free, exact, egoless). Each helping to carve out small pieces and define the shape that is his quality.

The quality is alive in that it make us feel alive in them, whole in that they don't contradict the vision of the man who made them, comfortable for they are made for real people who seek comfort which is not absolute, free in it's form to take any shape that we wish to impart it, and yet exact in that some structure must be upheld for some regular shape to take place instead of chaos; it must carry thoughtfulness which makes things work towards some benefit instead of just existing or even destroying.

I for myself can say that I felt this quality in a wooden house up north where my family sometimes go on vacation. I remember entering this building mesmerized, looking at the scenery of mountains when looking outside, grapevines growing on the sides of the main walk way and the calmness which the environment had. The peace. How warm the house felt, with the green grass complimenting it's nature; the cozy old feel which is given by the slight screeching sounds of wood when walking. The fun we had as we all sat around the big table after cooking a meal, going to the pool, enjoying life, eating to our hearts content, laughing together. All these attributes contributed into making a kind of quality which I had not felt from any other house I had been to. It facilitated the place for our once in a year meet-ups that have were in great part a succeeded because of it.

## Shaped By Events

> "A building or a town is given it's character, essentially, by those events which keep on happening there most often." [pp 66]

Alexander recognizes that the quality lies in the events that happen in a place more than the place itself; yet they can not be separated as they effect each other, for without the place there would be no events. The roads that we use to get around, the parks that we use to communicate with our friends, small areas of privacy that allow for intimacy, are places where events that take place in them are helped by the environment within which they occur in. Each part of a village in this way can contribute to the holistic dream that fits with our nature.

We can see this clearly in my wooden house story. The place was the enabler for all the events which occurred in it. Whether playing around the pool or sitting in the Jacuzzi, cooking meat with the boys, sitting around a large table eating together, enjoying the mountain view, or playing games in the large living room space we had; all these good memories of the place are only enabled by it, and enacted by us. You could say we lived the dream behind the house, carefully arranged to make us enjoy getting closer and socializing, backed with it's pretty and appeasing appearance.

But what about the counter example? What happens when the place is not an enabler for events?

## Modernity

After a couple of successful family gatherings, due to security reasons our family decided to go to a different place, this time Eilat. There we gathered in a narrow cramped street housing many homes of different likely rich people. The house itself had a weird layout and separation of rooms, a big pool, large modern kitchen, and lots of large windows. The view was of mostly other houses and to our right a bit of Jordan, and not a whole lot of vegetation. Look wise I can say it definitely was not the most comforting house. 

Unfortunately for us, we were in a large city where many wanted to go shopping on their own. This caused early separation until we eventually all came back to eat. The table was a rectangular shape so hearing someone on the other side was difficult. At night some wanted to go out to a bar and some didn't which created a dispute. There were hardly any truly "quite" places so we hung couldn't really separate slightly if we wanted. And as you might have guessed we didn't really play with one another leading to a very disappointing trip. 

This kind of experience is the author of the book disdains in modern building. He claims it is lifeless, boring almost, and so modular and reused that it lacks any character or beauty. They don't facilitate the events that people want and need for they are built not for the people's needs. Neighborhoods are created from several apartments copied around, A modern apartment building is usually built by creating the first flat and copying it for the next however many floors required. A flat is created by the first half and mirroring it. A half is created by the idea of several people who think of something which will satisfy the common buyer. I think you can see how this might be problematic.

## Randomness

---------- In much of the same nature that history doesn't repeat, it rhymes, he wants our buildings to rhyme not repeat one another. 

In much of the same way that modern culture builds, nature also uses repeating structures to design, yet, we don't find trees repeat the same way: although there are many trees, each of their twigs and leaves are have slight variations all over, giving them their character and uniqueness. They follow the pattern of a leave or twig as we recognize them yet contain variations we appreciate. The slight randomness of nature is something we as humans appreciated and maybe even to a degree need. 

Modern building is centralized in the hands of a few architects. To create the types of buildings we want is impossible though our current centralized way of building. Architects who build massive constructions may do so by abstracting the needs of the people and the events which occur in the places they build, but they do not attend to the specific needs the people have, they don't make the place unique. It is far too complex to do it in such a way. Needing an architect for each family or person which needs something to be designed and built is impossible. We simply can't have that many architects.

The timeless way of building is, in-fact, a decentralized process where people have a common shared language for building, and the building or town or village or city grow organically from the gradual attending of needs, the people themselves help to attend their needs they can tell not only what they are, but have a language to communicate it well. 

## Language

From a language that builds a house, building, park and so on.. to a language used to describe a village, town, city. The language he proposes it incomplete since it must utilize the people's ideas themselves to fit it into the specific area people and culture. To complete it a decentralized process of people trying the ideas must be done: define, discuss, criticize, and improve the patterns to fit the needs of the people. Then the last step is to share so the work of people is cumulative.

Each decision on it's own right not be perfect but with time, as you make wrong decisions you learn, modify, grow. We want autonomous people making their own decisions about how to build. But these people who we add should be allowed to make small changes to the whole and usually defined to what they can easily access and change (their own house, garden, so on..) and do so using the shared language they have. We know whether we are right or wrong when we feel a certain way. Every human will recognize this feeling when things are right or wrong. Because of their culture, location and past, people can share the meaning and experience of building and thus grow a town in according to the timeless method.

Nothing will cry so hard for it's own death as it wishes to be reborn anew, then a building that not longer fits it's owners.

## Always evolving

We want a building which is easy to modify and evolve, we want to attend to our current needs, not those 10 years ago. And for this we must do the changes on our own.



More thoughts: 

The language proposed is isomorphic in my mind to a formal method. It has axioms, which are truths about building, such as the space we have for a building is 100m^2, and light comes from the south-eastern side; it also has rules which we gather and learn about or invent, for how should we build given the axioms. The patterns which form inside the language have a great variety, but they always follow the rules. Another name which he gives this language is "rules of thumb". Everybody follows rules of thumb when, doing, well... most things in the world, and so does building. The strength of a language is it's compactness. We need just a few buildings blocks and rules to represent a great variety of possibilities. This allows both our chaotic individualistic nature and our need for structure to be served in one meal. The structure is kept by the rules but they don't confine our possibilities by a few options, instead allowing the randomness we like to take shape in whichever way fits best.

"Architects are responsible for no more than perhaps 5 percent of all the buildings in the world. 
Most buildings, streets, shops, offices, rooms, kitchens, cafes, factories, gas stations, freeways, bridges... which give the world it's form, come from an entirely different source. 
They come from the work of thousands of different people.
They come from the decisions of administrators, hardware store-owners, housewives, official building department, local bankers, carpenters, public works, departments, gardeners, painters, city councils, families ..."  [ pp 200 ]
			
It is a fact that this method can work, most of the world is built this way. Why not begin building using The Timeless Way?
