# Understanding The Problem  

Like Mike Acton has been saying for years and years. We need to first understand the problems we try to solve before solving them. If we understand the problems well the implementation or in other words, solution for the problem will present itself to you nicely. This ofcourse means that sometimes to understand the problem you need to explore it first. Creating bad designs that you will know are bad only after the fact.
