# Human over-optimization and Goodhart's law

As humans we want to optimize processes to achieve our goals in a more efficient manner. In doing so humans might over-optimize resulting in a different result than wanted.

In the education system, the goal in the beginning was to optimize the learning of the students. To do so, exams were invented. They were meant to give grades to students such that teachers could evaluate their performance and know who knows the material and who does not. 

But humans like to over-optimize, since they have a metric to optimize for in this case their grades, they might learn for the exam a day before or learning at home without listening at classes at all. This is sub-optimal for the initial requirement of knowing the knowledge imparted by their teachers, but optimal to get good grades with the least amount of effort. 

Another case we can look into is the car problem in America. In America people usually travel by car, almost exclusively so. This is unlike other nations where people might walk to a near by location or use public transport. 
The reason for America's reliance on cars is their past optimization for travel by car. The roads are concrete roads that make travel by car easy but make the cities unwalkable. 

Once again people over-optimize for the initial goal of easy car travel and now, it is hard to go back. With most Americans needing a car as it is the best way to move around, this creates a endless cycle of more people need more roads and more roads make other options less desirable since the price of going to other methods of travel is too high. 



**e.g. Bryan Jonson**
For example Bryan Jonson's blueprint for many might be a great example where his measurements help him optimize to his ultimate goal of reverse ageing. Yet these measurements around bio markers can not fully tell how much he is "reversing" his age. Also there is some stress when it comes to having to meet goals he sets himself of being in the optimal range of everything. It has to be an active thought and pursuit which usually, for most people causes some stress, which we know is bad for ageing. Maybe even causing a reverse reaction then what he expects[^2].
