# Combat-Aircrafts-Are-Scary


There are time I want to reflect on myself. What have I learned this year? Can I spend my time in a better way? Is there a point in the things I continue doing?

I want to reflect since at any moment I might catch a disease and die. At any moment I can lose everything that I might love and care for. At any moment a country leader might choose to detonate a mass killing bomb on my city. The possibility is there. In our everyday lives we don’t notice the degree of our own weakness. How weak we are against the giants of society.

Nations, States, Societies are able to use their resources to develop crazy things for the “benefit” of man kind. Yet I can’t help but be critical of these efforts. Lately I began maintaining some systems on combat airplanes. The first times I was near these monsters I was scared for my life. I understood how many things MUST BE correct in order to not kill me. It screwed with my head. Think about big bombs, super strong lasers, high wattage communication systems, loud engines, and cancerous radiation emitting radar. Every moving component can hit you, demobilize you, or straight up kill you. This is a KILLING MACHINE.

Every single component was made so the pilot can exercise the killing power of this monster of a machine in order to execute missions. The limiting factor in the ability of aircraft is the HUMAN, not the machine.

Humans are unable maintain high-G maneuvers for a large amount of time since we were not born to do so. Combat airplanes were created specifically to be able to do crazy maneuvers fast, and with precision to execute missions out maneuvering competitors.

I am scared yes. But time heals all wounds and I am no longer afraid. This seems to be me relaxing more and more around the crazy machine since I have belief that there is nothing to be afraid of. Nothing will go "wrong" and eventually kill me. It is trust that only time can buy. The terrifying part is how fast I got used to it. 

Humans tend to forget just how crazy tech has become lately. How little do we know of the things we create, and how scary it would be to someone just a couple hundred years ago to see this flying aircraft quickly disappearing into the sky with a loud sound trying to catch up. How terrifying are the guns, bombs, and other new tech is to a people even just a century ago, let alone a thousand years ago.
