# Notes On War

My Story:

On October 7, Israel faced the biggest ground attack by Hamas it has ever encountered. Hamas managed to kill more than a thousand Israeli citizens, inciting great hate and a overwhelming response. At the time it happened I was home alone, my parents over seas on a vacation and my sister at her home. Then I received a phone call. It was my commander, he told me to find a way to reach the base in any way I could. When I questioned what happened he said "open the tv".
It was then I understood we were at war. I tried to call up friends, and see whether there was anyone who could take me to the base. All my tries but to no avail. I informed my commander that I can not reach the base that day. 

The next day in the morning, getting out of my house was quite scary. Especially in uniform. You don't know whether there are Hamas militants somewhere near to targeting you. All form of safety I had known for years was lost after knowing Hamas was deep inside Israel. After reaching the bus station I got on my bus and was on my way. People I know who got on the bus too talked to me. Some said they did not know of the attack at all they had no phone on Shabbat. 

On the way to the base I could see army vehicles of many kinds, some tanks, some simple armored vehicles. All on their way to the south where most of the militants came from and are concentrated at. You could even hear a military air plane roam the skies. The feeling of war was in the air and it very much looked like it. 

After reaching my base, and getting ready, I went to my work place and I was told "You are now going to help drag bombs". For four days all I saw was the tractor a bomb cart and bombs. The amount of bombs we had to drag was overwhelming. When I spoke with my friend about it she said the base has never seen this amount of bomb production and bomb dropping in all her time in the base. We worked for 6 hours and rested for 12 which meant we had no consistent rest schedule. Instead, we worked twice in the day and once at night, all the time dragging bombs in our tractor. Hearing the loud noises of fighter-jets flying above us on their way to bomb Gaza. 

After these 4 days, I came back to my work place, to find many new faces these were the reservists who got called up. For 2 weeks after these 4 days I continued working hard in trying both to make sure there are many good units we could use to replace faulty ones. Along with it I learned as much as I could from the reservists who came. 

At some point we had a goal of mending some of our faulty test hardware that helps us fix faulty units. This is hardware that worked last 10 or 15 years ago but no longer works. And so I began taking it upon myself to mend all stations that we can. 

So far I was unsuccessful. With lacking parts, dying computers, weird software requirements and more I couldn't fix these stations. But the fight has not ended and I am still trying.  

Notes: 

There are a couple of things that I want to take note. Mainly about justice. It is hard to really say anything about right or wrong in war as all sides lose. The perspective that I now have is that war is usually justified by the situation. Regardless of outsiders perspective, those who participate in war have a good reason for it. They justify it with that reason and act accordingly.
