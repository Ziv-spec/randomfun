# Meaning

Life is built around signaling. Messages are sent all the time with some intent we want others to be able to understand. Humans use language as a medium for communication allowing messages to be understood. But where does the meaning lay? Is it in the message itself or in the one sending/receiving it?

Messages are usually sent in a encoder to message to decoder scheme, where first one has to have a idea or something with meaning to convey, then encode some message in some way send it for someone to decode the message, hopefully getting the meaningful idea across. This scheme tells us that we can have information which is critical for understanding the message in 3 locations. 

If all of the meaning is contained in the message then any alien civilization, artificial intelligence, animal should be able to understand the message so long as they are intelligent enough. If the message is contained in the decoder like for example different minds can receive the same message but end up understanding from it completely different ideas. 

Think about our reality, if all of the meaning were to be in the environment which decodes the DNA in our bodies then we should all have the same DNA but have the environment decide for us what should we look like. The fact of the matter is that this is not the case. We know that our DNA seems to contain information since different DNA produce different people. Yet without the environment which tells us how to decode this DNA we would not be here. In this case as we can see both the medium for passing messages contain information and meaning and a decoder contains information for how to decode this message correctly. Without it we would not be able to understand the "message" our DNA tries to convey.

The difficult part about understanding where the information lays in a given system is that it can be split across the message passed and the decoder. This means that some information will stay hidden not allowing us to understand some messages regardless of how much we try. 

Another example of this split would be a image compressor. A lossless compressor can have many ways in which it can encode an image to compress it's "meaning". One way would be to give them a smaller representation based on statistical frequencies. So a pixel whos color is more like to show up will take up less bits to represent. This scheme would allow any one who wants to decode the message simply decode the compressed message by replacing compressed form of pixels with their colors. Another scheme for compressing the message could be to do a simple counting of similar pixels and grouping of them together. This would in-fact make the algorithm on the decoding end, contain information it did not contain before. It now knows that pictures contain many similar colored pixels one after the other. This type of information we can not deduce from the message itself. It is unique to the encoder/decoder scheme which we propose here. This unique information is exactly why the information of a message might be contained in the message passed as well as the decoder which decodes it.
