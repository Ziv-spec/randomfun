# Cutting Weed

In my time in the army I have had the experience of cutting weed many times. We were required to cut all plants in the circular area around the place we were working. And so we did. 
After waking up at 7:30 I take a small bad containing my morning routine goods. I brush my teeth, clean my face and put on my uniform. After a small break it is already 7:45, so I put on sunscreen and sun glasses and I go out for a 10 minute walk to my work place. After walking under the hot sun, I have sweat built up from heat, my heart rate is up as I hurried to go under some shade. Looking at a orange building at a distance I speed up, as I anticipate my relief once I open the door. Entering the place has a nice cooling sensation the air conditioner was turned on not too long ago. After finishing some basic errands, I get called up to cut the weed and other plants that were not supposed to be around. I look around and I see 4 guys that came up to help. We all went outside reluctantly to take tools to at least not do all of this by hand. I looked at the clock it read 8:15, and so we began. Cutting and rooting the plants is no easy job when it is so hot outside. Since we are in the desert at summer, plants grow using the excess water they have access to near plants that get water from the water system around the place. After almost 30 minutes or so, we got called again. We needed to get rid of all the trash into the trash truck. By hand we began picking all the trash some using gloves some using their bare hands. I for example used gloves to pick trash and after finishing also continue cutting and rooting the plants. This has continued and continued. 10:10 we finally finish. I at this point was extremely tired, and have sweat all over my face and hands. Removing my gloves, water splashed out in respectable amount showing my hard work. We returned the tools, cleaning up after ourselves, only to continue with work right after.
This has continued on and on and on. 

If you don't remove plants by their roots they will regrow and regrow seemingly endlessly in hospital environments. Regardless of amount, it seems like this stress does not budge the plant at all. It might be that it grows better stronger when cut? There is a technique that takes a plant cuts it, and takes the stem of another (of the same kind) and puts it into the base of the other. Granting the plants the benefits of the base to the stem increasing plant growth and yield.
