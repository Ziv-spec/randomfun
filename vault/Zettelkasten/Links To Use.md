Things to explore in programming: 
- Theoretical vs Practical in programming
	Theoretical - Helps find limits and ideals to achieve in practice
	Practical - Is the thing that you actually end up doing in practice. This sometimes will be radically different since you have different constraints. 
- Compression - entropy, different techniques, how it is related to AI and intelligence. 
- Antifragile - as a methodology of programming (not in the absolute sense) which should be more in the sense of degeneracey robustness resiliance. 
- Structure 
- Abstraction 
- Exploration in programming as a "Art" 
- [Sketchpad example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ZsiBMnGSg&t=114s) which I thought about when I looked at [John Carmack twitter post](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1699918380533268502) (being what seems to be a ground breaking work for GUI development), imgui relating to Casey Muratori, doom for game programming, now AI software 2.0? 
- Constraints, how constraints help us deal with complexity, and make unmanageable things manageable
- SAT solvers? - this is something I have to deeply research about at some point 
- Large software companies produce code with the same structure of the development team, seem to obay price's law. 
    Efficiancy seems to not be a concern when "velocity" is a term commonly used so everything must be fast. 
- The problem of weak problem solving of people -

https://qntm.org/ratchet - cool idea of a ratchet in programming. You create the incentive to stop using something eventually leading to it's elimination (in terms of more use of it), even if you don't explicitly try to state that to your co-workers the meta program you create does hint it (incentivizing not adding certain old/bad patterns into the code). You can more easily do this in JAI where you can just look into the ast of the code in compile time and do analysis on it to warn/error when it finds some thing "bad" in the way you do stuff. Which is cool.

Actually interesting but totally unrelated link http://www.stanbenson.com/EconomyMarketAndProfitableInsights.html


This just shows that there is a ton of interesting good information and you may find it in the most absurd of ways when searching.
