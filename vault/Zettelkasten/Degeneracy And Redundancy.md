# Degeneracy And Redundancy



Within biological systems, there occurs natural degeneracy. Degeneracy is the ability of different components/paths within a system to perform the same function or yield the same output[^1]. This property is core in making biological systems survive in hectic environments. 

Examples for degeneracy in everyday things.

Language has degeneracy built into it's structure. English contains characters which are used over and over to describe words. The characters themselves are meaningless and only denote how to pronounce the words in a language. Words are the smallest intelligible pieces of language containing meaning by themselves. Sentences are using grammar and syntax to denote a coherent message. The degeneracy in this system is evident when you think about how many ways there are to describe the same thing. You may say "I like eating my food alone" and also "I do not like not consuming my food alone". Both contain the same meaning, they are equivalent yet are different ways of describing the same thing. Because there are constrains like grammar and syntax which allow language to be structured so there would be few ways of understanding the sentence. 

The amazing thing about language is how although there are some fundamental words whos meaning can not really be derived from other words if your vocabulary is not large enough, at some point if it is large enough you can begin to convey the meaning of words using other words. This allows for a robust way for extending the language. Which is an incredible way of doing things. 

A defining characteristic of degeneracy is components with partially overlapping and context-dependent functions. This kind of degeneracy is a fundamental feature of language. Different words are rarely synonymous, i.e. pure redundancy is rare. Instead, most seemingly interchangeable words are degenerate, “_different structures with overlapping, context-dependent function(s)_”.



Unlocking your phone has become resilient to failure. On my phone the main method for unlocking the device is using the fingerprint sensor on the back. One day a system update caused the phone to stop recognizing the fingerprint sensor, not allowing me to unlock the phone using it. The phone like all modern ones, allows in such cases to fall back to using a passcode or a pin to unlock the phone. 

The screen which allows you to enter a password is not it's primary action and yet when needed it took over the function of the fingerprint sensor. On other phones you might find the camera unlock working instead. These are the components which makes the phone resilient to these types of failures by using components who can fill in the roll even if it is not their main one. The use of such solutions increases the software complexity but keeps the system functioning after failure.

**Conclusion:**
It might be accurate to say that the emergent behavior of a degenerate system is resilience. The method of achieving resilience is that of having systems be able to provide replacement of function using different kinds of structures. 

*One thing that is important to note about features in complex systems:* 
If you have too many features and want to control the complexity of the system it would be beneficial to limit the scope. Think about taking a system that has to do 2 things and then saying "hey why not add 100 more things for it to do" this would lead to complexity exploding. And yet for some systems having more features is beneficial for making the system have a way for recovering from failure when things do fail. As any good system which has some priority of safety would show, redundancy and degeneracy are amazing for the systems reliability in lesser predictable conditions, and yet cause more complexity and less understanding of how the system would react when it does indeed fail. The trade-off in this case is between not failing on the general case but when you do fail you fail big, and maybe failing more but doing so gracefully leading to minor damage if any at all.
